/**
 * Fractional indexing for `Page.position`.
 *
 * Copied from the tracker's `rank.ts` rather than imported: modules do not depend on one another,
 * and a pure algorithm is the one thing worth duplicating. Keep them in step if either changes.
 *
 * A page tree must survive concurrent edits: two people dragging different pages at the same time
 * should not have to renumber anything. Each page therefore carries a short string key, and moving
 * one between two siblings only mints a new key strictly between its neighbours — no other row is
 * touched, and the result sorts with a plain string comparison.
 *
 * The alphabet is ordered by code point (digits, uppercase, lowercase) so lexicographic order and
 * numeric order agree, which is what `ORDER BY position` in Postgres relies on.
